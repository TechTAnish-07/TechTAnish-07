🧠 About Me

I’m a 3rd-year B.Tech CSE student at IIIT Tiruchirappalli (2023–2027) with a strong interest in backend systems, scalable web applications, and problem solving.

I enjoy turning ideas into clean, maintainable software, whether it’s through Spring Boot APIs, React frontends, or efficient algorithms.
I regularly participate in competitive programming to sharpen my thinking and write better code.
